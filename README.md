# YouBike, Sharing Bike Data Analysis

Welcome to the YouBike Sharing Bike Data Analysis project! This project is focused on analyzing data from the YouBike shared bike service in Taiwan. By examining usage patterns based on time and zip codes, I aim to uncover insights that can help improve the service and better understand user behavior.

## Project Description

The primary goal of this project is to perform a detailed data analysis of YouBike usage. We analyze various aspects such as:
- Usage patterns over different times of the day
- Geographical distribution of bike usage across different zip codes

This analysis helps in identifying trends and potential areas for improvement in the YouBike service.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Time-based usage analysis
- Zip code-based geographical analysis
- Visualization of usage patterns

## Tools and Libraries

This project is implemented using the following tools and libraries:

- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data analysis and visualization.
- **Python**: The core programming language used for the analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
