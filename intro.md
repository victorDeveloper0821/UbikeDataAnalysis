# YouBike Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze the usage patterns of YouBike, catering to both commuters and leisure cyclists. With approximately 1400 stations across the city, YouBike plays a significant role in urban transportation, offering convenient and eco-friendly mobility options for residents and visitors alike.

In my free time, I enjoy using the YouBike service to explore the city. As a result, I aim to provide insightful data visualizations that tell the story of bike usage frequency and forecast the availability of parking lots across these numerous stations.

Provided are data visualizations and interpretations of correlations among the various data columns.

Feel free to explore the sections below to discover more insights.
